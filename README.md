# Auto-battle Demo
My auto-battle game inspired by Loop Hero.

You have a hero fighting against three zombies. You can tweak each unit's stats such as HP, attack and attack
cooldown so that may change the battle result.

The battle is animated in Loop Hero style. Attacks are animated with
an addition frame and being attacked is animated with monochromatic images. 

Dead units disappear and stop attacking.
